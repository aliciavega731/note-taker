# Note Taker üìù

Note Taker was created for the person that likes to write things down. You'll never forget anything again and when you no longer need it, just delete it. This application utilizes API storage instead of session memory thanks to Express.js

Don't forget to get stuff done -- [write it down.](https://evening-thicket-45514.herokuapp.com/)
